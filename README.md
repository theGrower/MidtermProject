Boot Camp Midterm Project
This is a Console P.O.S. program designed in collaborate with two other developers as part of our Boot Camp experience through Grand Circus.
One of the team members has explicit knowledge of Steelcase products, so we did use some information from this company. 
This program is in no way affiliated with Steelcase or Steelcase products whatsoever. 

The major goal was to incorporate the skills we've learned thus far using the OOP C# programming language.
